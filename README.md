# LinearProgrammingProject
In this project our team of four people solved a Mixed Integer Linear Programming Problem. We were tasked with solving a problem related to snow removal from Montreal.We had to decide how to create a plan to remove snow from 10 sections of the city into 5 disposal sites. Contraints included capacity and one section can only have one disposal site that it is tranported to. The goal was to minimize the cost of the whole process. Cost was based on distance or travel, how much snow had to be removed, and the cost for removing one meter cubed of snow.
